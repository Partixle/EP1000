                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>A programming language is used to convey the Progammer’s thoughts into instructions for the microprocessor to understand. To translate english-like instructions to machine code, a middile-ground is required, which is done so by computer programming language. They can be understood by humans, and can also easily and accurately convert the language into binary by compiling the code for the microprocessor to understand. Such programming languages include Python and C/C++. It is important that the instructions of the programmer be conveyed accurately into the programming language as the microprocessor ONLY follows the instructions-to-the-letter by the programming language. If your code is wrong/has errors, the microprocessor reproduces these errors. There are 3 main types of error: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Syntax Error: </b>This error occur when the programmer does not follow the rules of the programming language, such as missing a semi-colon. They are the most common errors and are easily caught by the compiler</li>
                        <li><b>Logical Error:</b> This error is made by the programmer in developing the logic of the program, such as using imperial units instead of metric. </li>
                        <li><b>Semantic Error: </b>This error occur during improper use of program statements, such as using the function 'Break' when there is no loop to break. </li>    
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Variables and Data types in Arduino</h3>
                    <p>Variables are storage that can be called out during a program. In order to use them, they must first be declared like so: [Data Type] [identifier] = value. The value can be fixed, calculated or from another variable. The value also doesn not have to be specified immediately, it can be assigned a value at a later part of the program. Variables only exist in the region that they are declared. Local variables are declared in a function or a block, and can only be used in there. Global variables are defined outside any function, usually at the top of the program and they exist throughout the entire program. </p>
                        
                    <p>There are many types of data, and variables and functions have to have their data type specified.  Different data types are implemented differently and they require different amount of memory to store data. Some common data types include: </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>bool/boolean: </b>Stores 'true' or 'false'. Uses 1 byte</li>
                        <li><b>char: </b>Stores a character. Uses 1 byte</li>
                        <li><b>unsigned char/byte: </b>Stores a number from 0 to 255. Uses 1 byte</li>
                        <li><b>int: </b>Stores a integer from -32766 to +32767. Uses 2 byte</li>
                        <li><b>unsigned int/word/short:</b>Stores a integer from 0 to +65535. Uses 2 byte</li>
                        <li><b>long:</b>Stores a integer from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. Uses 4 byte</li>
                        <li><b>float/double:</b>Stores numbers with decimal point, ranging from -3.4028235E+38 to 3.4028235E+38. Uses 4 byte</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>When you require a value to stay constant through-out the program and you want to keep track of it using a identifier. Declare a constant by typing const before the data type. </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Functions: </b>any words that end with a (), or (...) are functions. They are block of codes that can be called out for execution, which afterwards, can return a value depending on the type of function depending on the word in front of the functions. (Void returns no values, int returns an integer, string returns a string, char</li>
                        <li><b>pinMode(PIN, INPUT/OUTPUT); :</b> Initialise the pin number if it is either a INPUT or an OUTPUT </li>
                        <li><b>digitalWrite(PIN, HIGH); :</b> Turn on the device connected to the pin</li>
                        <li><b>delay(x); :</b> Wait for x milliseconds before executing the next line of code</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <h3>Operators</h3>
                    <p>Operators are symbols that are used to perform a specific mathematical or logical operation. </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Arithmetic: </b>Execute a mathematical operation which gives a numerical result. '=' assign a value to an operand, '+' add, '-' subtract, '*' multiply, '/' divide. </li>
                        <li><b>Comparison: </b> Compares 2 operands to give a logical result(true of false). '==' equality, '!=' not equal to, '&rt;' greater than, '&lt;' less than.</li>
                        <li><b>Boolean operators: </b>Compare 2 or more operations to give a logical result(true or false). &amp;&amp; AND, '||' OR, '!' logical NOT. 
                        <li><b>Bitwise operators: </b> changes the bit pattern of the operator. '&amp;' and. '|' or, '!' not/inverse, '«' shift left, '»' shift right</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Control Statements</h3>
                    <p>Control statements provide a means of decision making. A condition is first tested. If the result is true, then the code for Task A is executed. Else, the code for Task B is executed. Control statements are provided using the 'if' and 'else' statement. The condition statement must return a boolean result. 'if' statements can be nested using more 'if', whereas else statements can be nested using 'else if' statement</p>
                        
                    <h3>Loops</h3>
                    <p>Loops provide a means of performing a task or executing a block of statements repeatedly. There are different types of loops that loops function in different ways. </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>while(...): </b> The loop starts if the condition in the bracket is true. When the block of code in the while statement is finished, the condition is checked again, and the block of code executes again if the condition is true. </li>
                        <li><b>do ... while(...): </b>The condition is only checked after the block of code is executed once, unlike while(...) loops, where the condition is checked before. </li>
                        <li><b>for(...): </b>Loops a certain number of times by using a initialised variable. In the bracket, a variable is specifed to be used or a new variable can be initialised, the condition for the loop to execute, and the increment of the variable after every cycle. </li>
                    </ol>
