                    <p>In order to make information available on the World Wide Web, we need to develop a website using HTML (HyperText Markup Language). The language describes how the information is to be displayed in a web browser. On top of HTML which creates and present information, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is required to format the information into a uniform, consistent and pleasing nature. I learned HTML with videos on youtube (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWPMSSsVdPk"> Learn HTML in 12 Minutes</a>) </p>
                    
                    <p> A HTML file consist of elements, such as header, paragraph, numbered list etc, and these elements are represented by tags such as h1, h2 and h3 for headers, p for paragraph and nl for numbered list. Elements must be encased in &lt;&gt; and elements comes in pairs, the opening tag, and the closing tag which has a / before the element in the angle brackets.</p>
                    
                    <p> <i>&lt;tagname&gt;content goes here...&lt;/tagname&gt; </i> </p>
                    
                    <p>HTML files are edited with text editors such as Notepad++, Brackets and Atom. In order to display the HTML document, the HTML file must be opened with a web browser such as chrome by dragging the file into the browser.
