                    <p> Fablab @ Singapore Polytechnic has a large number of tools, equipment and machinery which we can use to fabricate our project. In the course of the module, we will be taught the operation of some of these tools and equipment, but firstly, we would have to ensure our safety in the lab which requires us to take the Safety Assessment. The documentation and notes for the couse are provided on the E-learning Site at SP which we can go through before taking the Safety Assessment. </p>
